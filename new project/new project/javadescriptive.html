                    </p>
            </div>
            <div id="syntax" class="content-section active">
                <h2>Syntax</h2>
                <p>Class Declaration: Java programs are structured as classes which serve as blueprints for objects.<br><br>
                    Main Method: The entry point of a Java application is the public static void main(String[] args) method.<br><br>
                    Identifiers: Names for classes, variables, and methods, which must start with a letter, $, or _.,<br><br>
                    Keywords: Reserved words like class, public, static, and void with predefined meanings.<br><br>
                    Data Types: Includes primitive types (e.g., int, boolean) and non-primitive types (e.g., arrays, classes).<br><br>
                    Operators: Include arithmetic, relational, logical, and assignment operators for various operations.<br><br>
                    Control Statements: Direct program flow using if, else, switch, loops (for, while), and branching (break, continue).<br><br>
                    Methods: Define behaviors with declarations that can accept parameters and return values.<br><br>
                    Inheritance: Allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.<br><br>
                    Exception Handling: Manages runtime errors using try, catch, and finally blocks, and the throw keyword.</p><br>
            </div>
            <div id="Comments" class="content-section active">
                <h2>Comments</h2>
                <p>Single-Line Comments: Use // to mark the beginning of a comment, which extends to the end of the line.<br><br>
                    Multi-Line Comments: Enclosed between /* and */, spanning multiple lines.<br><br>
                    Documentation Comments: Use /** and */ to create comments that can be processed by Javadoc to generate API documentation.<br><br>
                    Purpose: Comments are used to explain code, making it easier to understand and maintain.<br><br>
                    Single-Line Example: // This is a single-line comment.<br><br>
                    Multi-Line Example: /* This is a multi-line comment that spans several lines */.<br><br>
                    Documentation Example: /** This is a documentation comment for describing a class or method */.<br><br>
                    Placement: Comments can be placed anywhere in the code, either on their own line or at the end of a line of code.<br><br>
                    Ignored by Compiler: Comments are not executed by the compiler; they are purely for human readers.<br><br>
                    Best Practices: Use comments to clarify complex logic, describe the purpose of variables, methods, and classes, and provide additional context where necessary.<br>       <br>              </p>
            </div>
            <div id="Variables" class="content-section active">
                <h2>Variables</h2>
                <p>Definition: Variables are containers used to store data in a Java program, identified by a unique name.<br><br>
                    Declaration: In Java, variables must be declared with a specific data type before they can be used.<br><br>
                    Data Types: Java supports primitive data types (e.g., int, double) and reference data types (e.g., String, arrays).<br><br>
                    Syntax: Variable declaration follows the pattern: data_type variable_name;.<br><br>
                    Initialization: Variables can be initialized at the time of declaration or later in the code.<br><br>
                    Scope: Variables have a scope that defines where they can be accessed within the program.<br><br>
                    Lifetime: Variables exist within their defined scope and are destroyed when the scope ends.<br><br>
                    Naming Conventions: Variable names should be meaningful, following camelCase naming conventions.<br><br>
                    Immutable and Mutable: Some data types, like primitives, are immutable (cannot be changed), while others, like objects, are mutable (can be modified).<br><br>
                   <br><br>Usage: Variables are used to store and manipulate data, facilitating dynamic behavior and computation in Java programs. <br><br>
            </p>
            </div>
            <div id="Operators" class="content-section active">

                   <br><br> Relational Operators: Compare values and include operators like equal to (==), not equal to (!=), greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=), and less than or equal to (<=).
                    <br><br>Logical Operators: Combine boolean expressions and include logical AND (&&), logical OR (||), and logical NOT (!).
                    <br><br>Assignment Operators: Assign values to variables and include simple assignment (=) as well as compound assignment operators like +=, -=, *=, and /=.
                    <br><br>Increment and Decrement Operators: Increase (++), or decrease (--), the value of a variable by 1.
                    <br><br>Conditional Operator (Ternary Operator): A shorthand for if-else statements, in the form of condition ? expression1 : expression2.
                    <br><Br>Bitwise Operators: Manipulate individual bits of integer operands and include bitwise AND (&), bitwise OR (|), bitwise XOR (^), left shift (<<), and right shift (>>).
                    <br><br>Instanceof Operator: Checks whether an object is an instance of a particular class or interface.
                    <br><br>Equality Operators: Test for equality (==) and inequality (!=) between two operands.
                    <br><br>Precedence and Associativity: Operators have precedence and associativity rules that determine the order in which they are evaluated within expressions.
                     </p>

            <div id="java Strings" class="content-section active">
                <h2>Strings</h2>
                <p>Definition: In Java, strings are sequences of characters, represented by the String class.<br><br>
                    Immutable: Strings are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once they are created.<br><br>
                    Initialization: Strings can be initialized using double quotes (e.g., "Hello").<br><Br>
                    Concatenation: Strings can be concatenated using the + operator (e.g., "Hello, " + "World").<br><br>
                    Methods: The String class provides methods for various string operations like length(), substring(), indexOf(), etc.<br><br>

            </div>
            <div id="Java While Loop" class="content-section active">
                <h2>While loop</h2>
                <p>While Loop: A control flow statement in Java used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
                    <br><br>Syntax:<br><br>
                    while (condition) {<br><br>
                        // code block to execute while condition is true
                    }<br><br>
                    Execution: The condition is evaluated before each iteration. If it evaluates to true, the code block is executed; otherwise, the loop terminates.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="Java For Loop" class="content-section active">
                <h2>For loop</h2>

            </div>
            <div id="Arrays" class="content-section active">
                <h2>Arrays</h2>
                <p>Arrays: Arrays are data structures in Java used to store multiple values of the same data type under a single name.
                    <br><br>Declaration: Arrays are declared using square brackets [], specifying the data type and the size of the array.
                    <br><br>Initialization: Arrays can be initialized with values at the time of declaration or later using assignment statements.
                    <br><br> Indexed Access: Elements of an array are accessed using index values starting from 0.
                    <br><br>Fixed Size: Arrays have a fixed size once they are initialized, and the size cannot be changed during runtime.

                <h2>Break/Continue</h2>
                <p>Break Statement: Used in loops (e.g., for, while) and switch statements to terminate the loop or switch block prematurely.
                    <br><br>Usage: When encountered, the break statement causes the immediate exit from the loop or switch block.
                    <br><br>Example:
                    <br><br>for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                        <br><br>if (i == 5) {
                            <br><br>break; // exits the loop when i equals 5
                            <br><br>}<br><br>
                        System.out.println(i);
                    }<br><br>
                    <br><br> Continue Statement: Used in loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration.
                    <br><br>Usage: When encountered, the continue statement jumps to the next iteration of the loop without executing the remaining code in the loop body.
                    <br><br>Example:
                    <br><br>for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                        <br><br>if (i == 5) {
                            <br><br>continue; // skips the rest of the iteration when i equals 5
                            <br><br>}
                            <br><br>System.out.println(i);
                            <br><br> }

            <div id="Java Methods" class="content-section active">
                <h2>Methods</h2>
                <p>Methods: In Java, methods are functions defined within classes to perform specific tasks.
                    <br><br> Usage: Methods encapsulate reusable blocks of code, promoting modularity and code organization in Java programs.
                    </p>
            </div>
            <div id="Java Method Parameter" class="content-section active">
                <h2>Method parameter</h2>
                <p>Method Parameters: Inputs provided to a method to customize its behavior or provide data for computation.
                    <br><br>Usage: Parameters are declared within method parentheses and can be used inside the method body to perform operations or calculations.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="Java Method Overloading" class="content-section active">
                <h2>Method overloading</h2>
                <p>Method Overloading: A feature in Java that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists.
                    <br><br>Usage: Enables the creation of methods that perform similar tasks but operate on different types or numbers of parameters, enhancing code readability and flexibility.
                    </p>
            </div>
            <div id="Java scope" class="content-section active">
                <h2> Java scope</h2>
                <p>Scope in Java: Refers to the visibility and lifetime of variables and methods within a program.
                    <br><br>Local Scope: Variables declared inside a method or block are accessible only within that method or block.
                    <br><br>Class Scope: Variables declared at the class level (outside any method) are accessible to all methods within the class.
                    <br><br>Instance Scope: Instance variables belong to specific instances of a class and are accessible to all methods within that instance.
                    <br><br>Static Scope: Static variables belong to the class itself and are shared among all instances of the class, accessible without creating an object.
                    </p>
            </div>
            <div id="Java Recursion" class="content-section active">
                <h2>Recusion</h2>
                <p>Recursion: A programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem.
                    <br><br> Base Case: A condition in a recursive function that stops the recursive calls and provides a termination point.
                    <br><br>Usage: Recursion is used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems.
                    <br><br>Example: Computing factorial or Fibonacci series, traversing trees or graphs, and solving problems like Tower of Hanoi.
                    <br><br>Caution: Infinite recursion can lead to stack overflow errors, so ensuring a base case is crucial for termination.
                    </p>
            </div>
            <div id="classes-objects" class="content-section">
                <h2>Java Classes and Objects</h2>
                <p>Classes: Templates or blueprints for creating objects in Java, defining their properties and behaviors.
                    <br><br>Objects: Instances of classes, representing real-world entities, with their own state and behavior.
                    <br><br>Encapsulation: Classes encapsulate data (fields) and methods to manipulate that data, providing abstraction and modularity.
                    <br><br>Instantiation: Objects are created from classes using the new keyword, allocating memory and initializing fields.
                    <br><br>Usage: Classes and objects facilitate code organization, reuse, and maintenance in object-oriented programming paradigms.
